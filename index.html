    <p>JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 95% of websites using it for this purpose. Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM. All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user's device.</p>
    <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>

    <p>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.</p>
    <p>Originally used only in web browsers, JavaScript engines are also now embedded in server-side website deployments and non-browser applications.

Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>

    <p>A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable.</p>
    <p>This tutorial will cover what variables are, how to declare and name them, and also take a closer look at the difference between var, let, and const. We will also review the effects of hoisting and the significance of global and local scope to a variable’s behavior.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Scope">
    <header>Scope</header>
    <p>Scope in JavaScript refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of variables to JavaScript. The two types of scope are local and global: Global variables are those declared outside of a block. Local variables are those declared inside of a block.</p>
    <p>The new keywords let and const, however, are block-scoped. This means that a new, local scope is created from any kind of block, including function blocks, if statements, and for and while loops.</p>

    <p>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it</p>
